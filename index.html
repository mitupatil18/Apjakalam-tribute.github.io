                    Even though APJ Abdul Kalam was an average student, his desire to read and spend hours studying and learning Mathematics, proved to create a strong foundation in his initial stage of education. Upon completing his schooling at Rameshwaram Elementary School and Schwartz Higher Secondary School, he continued his graduation in Physics from Saint Joseph's College and later in 1955, he studied Aerospace Engineering at Madras Institute of Technology. <br> <br> When we talk about APJ Abdul Kalam's education, it is quite prominent that he always wanted to make a successful career in Aviation. Becoming a fighter pilot was once his dearest dream, which was not fulfilled as he couldn't reach the final merit of IAF. After completing his higher education, Kalam joined the DRDO (Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation) as a scientist and late in the early 1960s, worked with the INCOSPAR (Indian National Committee for Space Research) under Vikram Sarabhai, a renowned space scientist. <br> <br>Even though he got immense opportunities to design hovercrafts and small helicopters, he was never convinced and always aimed for something bigger and there was no failure in this world that could stop him. Later, Abdul Kalam started independently working on expandable rocket projects at DRDO. Things took a magnificent turn when he received transfer orders to the ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) where he started as a project director of SLV-III, Indiaâ€™s first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle, which deployed the Rohini satellite into orbit the earth in July 1980.

                <p>
                    Dr Kalam was part of the Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR), which was set up by Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, father of Indian space programme. INCOSPAR, the team of rocket engineers of which Kalam was a part, set up the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) that is used by ISRO to launch sounding rockets even today.
                    Kalam was also the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit. Kalam has also played a contributory role in the development of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV).
                    Kalam has also won the prestigious Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan for his contributions to ISRO and DRDO, as well as for his role as a scientific advisor to the Government of India.
